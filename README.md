# Who's Gonna Poop

This plugin will highlight each player in brown if they are next up in the orb order to poop at Kephri.

## Important Usage Details

The plugin needs you to input whether Blowing Mud is on on the side panel. It will default to off, but you can change it to Blowing Mud by choosing "2 Poopers"

## How It Works

Upon entering Kephri, orbs will highlight and player models will be outlined based on who should be next to poop. The orbs and highlights will rotate each time a poop happens (even if only the flies show up).

## Known Limitations

If every player doesn't begin combat with Kephri before the first poop, it will de-sync the orbs. I'm trying to come up with a solution for this.
