# Who's Gonna Poop

This plugin will highlight each player in brown if they are next up in the orb order to poop at Kephri.

## Important Usage Details

The plugin needs you to input whether Blowing Mud is on on the side panel. It will default to off, but you can change it to Blowing Mud by choosing "2 Poopers"

## How It Works

Once combat starts with any NPC, the plugin will query the wiki to get a list of possible drops. (Some are filtered due to no one ever wanting them). In the future, it will be possible to filter items you'd like to see in your 'Bank Log'

## Known Limitations

If every player doesn't begin combat with Kephri before the first poop, it will de-sync the orbs. I'm trying to come up with a solution for this.
