# NPC Collection Log

This plugin shows a panel when you initiate combat with any NPC, showing information about which items are possible to receive from them, and which ones you've already got in your collection log, or in your bank.

## Important Usage Details

This plugin depends on collectionlog.net, which integrates with RuneLite through the Collection Log plugin.
Information here (https://github.com/evansloan/collection-log)

Just like with the Collection Log plugin, it requires you to open the collection log and look at the tabs. If you already are using the Collection Log plugin, you won't have to do anything.

## How To Use



Once combat starts with any NPC, the plugin will query the wiki to get a list of possible drops. (Some are filtered due to no one ever wanting them). In the future, it will be possible to filter items you'd like to see in your 'Bank Log'

You can update the highlight colors, or even set them to transparent here:
